SwitchBox

About
-----

SwitchBox lets you declare simple conditions and combine them into more complex conditions. These are used to decide which action to run.

The upshot is that messy if/elsif/else blocks are no longer necessary. All conditions are lazily evaluated and will only be ran once.

Conditions
----------

Although you give anything to be a condition, conditions should not have any side effects. The result caching on conditions is intended to help with expensive conditions. Some conditions may never be run. Only enough to find the first action to call.

    record = some_active_record_object
    
    box = SwitchBox.new
    box.condition(:saved) { record.save }

In this example, a condition named "saved" is created. Behind-the-scenes, you also get a "not_saved" condition.

Actions
-------

Actions are stored in the order they're declared, and the very first action to meet all of its conditions will be executed, and no others.

    # continuing from above code
    box.action(:saved)     { render :text => "the record was saved!" }
    box.action(:not_saved) { render :text => "there was a problem" }
    box.go
    
SwitchBox#go will look at the conditions for each action, and run appropriate action.


Alternate syntax
----------------
The above syntax is nice because you can pass the box around as needed, but for simple things, you can just do it all in one block

    SwitchBox.new do
      condition(:always_true) { true }
      action(:always_true) { puts "always printed" }
    end
    
In this case you don't need to call go, it gets called at the end of the block
